# Sprite-Mover-Again
I really need to finish this already

Use C# in the Unity Engine.
Display a 2D sprite on the screen.
Capture player input to move the sprite on the screen.
As long as the player is pressing the arrow, the sprite should continuously move in the selected direction.
(Note: It is okay if the sprite moves "really fast".)
The arrow keys will move the sprite in the direction pressed.
If the player presses the shift key plus the arrow, the sprite should only move 1 meter (1 unit in Unity) in the direction pressed, until the player releases and presses the arrow key again. 
(Note: This can be difficult, take time to think about what conditions cause this functionality to occur and how you can check for those conditions.)
If the user presses the space bar, the sprite should move (reset) to the center of the world.
If the user presses the P key, the component for moving the ship should disable.
If the user presses the P key while the movement component is disabled, the component for moving the ship should enable again.
If the user presses the Q key, the entire sprite GameObject should be set to inactive.
(Note: Yes, this "breaks" the game, but I need to see that you can disable entire GameObjects).
If the user presses the escape key, the project should exit cleanly.
